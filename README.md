#JSON Learning

##What is this?
This is a personal project to build a machine learning framework that can run
on JSON files. It will attempt to take big lists of identical json objects
and provide toolkits that can make meaningful predictions based on the inputs.

Ideally, it will be used to build something that can be thrown at data without
_that_ much thought.
